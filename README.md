## A Python package for reconstructing DIC images

While (currently) barebones, this package provides functonality for estimating shear angle and inverse filtering-based reconstruction for DIC microscopy. Future updates are to come to incorporate the following features:
- Additional reconstruction/contrast adjustment methods
- Optional quality metrics for optimising input parameter selection 
- CellPose interfacing for DIC-powered cell segmentation

#### Quickstart
To run a sample reconstruction using the provided agar bead image:

```bash
cd examples/
python run_recon.py
```

#### Requirements
DICsuite requires Python â‰¥3.8 and <3.12. Compatibility with Python 3.12+ is currently limited by external dependencies.
To install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Optional GPU Support
If you want to use GPU acceleration, install CuPy separately:

```bash
pip install cupy-cuda12x
```

#### Acknowledgements
Citation details are being finalised, pending inclusion of additonal reconstruction methodologies.
