# DICsuite
### A Python package for DIC-to-QPI reconstruction

This package provides functonality for reconstructing a quantitative estimation of phase from DIC microscopy.
In its current state, this is implemented by  shear angle estimation and inverse filtering-based reconstruction.
Logging and QC interfaces track computed shear angles, as well as a variety of quality metrics to assist users in selecting optimal input parameters for reconstruction. 

Future updates are to come to incorporate the following features:

- Additional reconstruction/contrast adjustment methods
- CellPose interfacing for DIC-powered cell segmentation
- Deep learning-powered reconstruction algorithms

#### Quickstart
To run a sample reconstruction using the provided agar bead image:

```bash
cd examples/
python run_recon.py
```

#### Requirements
DICsuite requires Python â‰¥3.8 and <3.12. Compatibility with Python 3.12+ is currently limited by external dependencies.
To install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Optional GPU Support
If you want to use GPU acceleration, install CuPy separately:

```bash
pip install cupy-cuda12x
```
